This project was created by following the a video created by "Brocode" on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaDUGPMjzOM&ab_channel=BroCode 
It uses the weather API "openweathermap.org" (must intialize api key for weather app to work)
This project was already completed before uploading to github but was later added to learn how to use Visual Studio Code and Github.
